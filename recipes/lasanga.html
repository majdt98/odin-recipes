    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Everyone loves a good lasagna, right? It's a great way to feed a crowd and a perfect dish to bring to a potluck. It freezes well. It reheats well. Leftovers will keep you happy for days.</p>
    <p>Simply Recipes reader Alton Hoover sent me his favorite recipe for lasagna which he has been cooking since his college days. Alton's original recipe created enough lasagna for a small army so I halved it. What is posted here will easily serve eight people.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Ground beef</li>
        <li>Bell peppers</li>
        <li>Onions</li>
        <li>Tomato sauce</li>
        <li>Tomato paste</li>
        <li>Crushed tomatoes</li>
    </ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Start by making the sauce with ground beef, bell peppers, onions, and a combo of tomato sauce, tomato paste, and crushed tomatoes. The three kinds of tomatoes gives the sauce great depth of flavor.</li>
    <li>Let this simmer while you boil the noodles and get the cheeses ready. We're using ricotta, shredded mozzarella, and parmesan -- like the mix of tomatoes, this 3-cheese blend gives the lasagna great flavor!</li>
    <li>From there, it's just an assembly job. A cup of meat sauce, a layer of noodles, more sauce, followed by a layer of cheese. Repeat until you have three layers and have used up all the ingredients.</li>
    <li>Bake until bubbly and you're ready to eat!</li>
</ol>
